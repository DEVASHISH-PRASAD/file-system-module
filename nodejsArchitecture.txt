Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.
JavaScript Runtime: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both server-side and client-side scripting. This unification of the development language simplifies the overall development process.Event-Driven and Asynchronous: Node.js is designed to be event-driven and asynchronous, making it well-suited for handling concurrent connections and building scalable network applications. This is achieved using an event loop that enables non-blocking I/O operations.
